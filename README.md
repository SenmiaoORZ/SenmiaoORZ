### Hi there 👋 Hyman Here 😊

I'm an ML Researcher focusing on Efficient Representation Learning and Efficient LLM Serving.

My passion for Machine Learning is not just a professional interest, but a personal one too. I love Cars (I drive a Manual Integra), Hantusu Miku, and the endless possibilities of Machine Learning.

🔭 I'm a master's student at U of M in the EECS department.

🌱 I'm currently learning linear algebra, and I believe this will deepen my understanding of many ML theories.

📫 How to reach me:  📮 : hymanzzs@umich.edu, 📱: 8149968190

I'm looking for research & industry opportunities in LLM serving, Efficient CV, and edge computing.
